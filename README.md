# aquariumtest

This project is to create an application using CRUD system, I have chosen to do an aqaurium test scheme.

today in SQL using GCP(google) I creadted a new instance (fmp) a new database (fmp) and two tables (tanks,tests) which has the basic data columns i need for this test.

26 July
I have updated my sql database to reduce the issue of a many to many relationship, I also wanted to make sure that whoever runs the test is documented for the test as you can have multiple users per tank and multiple tanks per user so splitting the tables into 3 gives me a user table, tank table and a test table which utilizes the user ID and tank ID.

I have created an ERD representing my work so far and I feel iit shows how useful this project will be for the real world utilizing the CRUD system.

I havent started my flask for this as I want to see everything within the lessons first using the flask blog.

webhook trial....
